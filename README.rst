Exostab 2.0 - Stability assessment for extrasolar planets
=========================================================

Exostab (/exo’stab/) is an online service intended to simplify dynamical stability assessment for extrasolar planetary systems. 

Instead of solving the gravitational three body problem over and over, Exostab pulls existing results from data-base of high precision, long term numerical orbit simulations - a 1000 CPU year’s worth of simulations to be exact - and presents regions of dynamical stability through a simple and intuitive API.

A web-based tool is accessible through the Astrodynamics and Planetary Exploration (APEX) group at UIUC at
https://apexgroup.web.illinois.edu/stability/index.html

The service is based on the following publications:
Georgakarakos, N., Eggl, S., Ali-Dip, M., & Dobbs-Dixon, I. (2024). Empirical stability criteria for 3D hierarchical triple systems I: Circumbinary planets. arXiv preprint `arXiv:2404.13746. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13746>`_
