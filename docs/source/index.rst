Welcome to Exostab 2.0 documentation!
===================================

**Exostab** (/exo'stab/) is an online service intended to simplify dynamical stability assessment for extrasolar planets.
Instead of solving the gravitational three body problem over and over, Exostab pulls existing results from data-base of 
high precision, long term numerical orbit simulations - a 1000 CPU year's worth of simulations to be exact - and  
presents regions of dynamical stability through a *simple* and *intuitive* API. 

Check out the :doc:`API` section for further information.

A :ref:`web-based tool <https://apexgroup.web.illinois.edu/stability/index.html>`_ is accessible through the 
:ref:`Astrodynamics and Planetary Exploration (APEX) <https://apexgroup.web.illinois.edu/>`_ group at UIUC.
